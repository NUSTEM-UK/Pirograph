Following (more-or-less) [this article](https://iotbytes.wordpress.com/python-flask-web-application-on-raspberry-pi-with-nginx-and-uwsgi/)

## Nginx

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  sudo apt install nginx
  sudo service nginx start

Check IP address in browser: should display a 'welcome to Nginx' page.

# Flask

  pip install flask
  pip3 install flask
  
Might as well do:

  pip3 install paho-mqtt
