✔ Set up form handler to [iterate over form fields](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7777850/iterating-over-submitted-form-fields-in-flask). @done(18-04-15 15:11)
    ☐ Initial working slice/iterator now in POST handler.
    ☐ ...and that needs a bit of a redesign of the instance variable / accessor method API for SkutterZero. Dammit.
✔ Implement instance variable data storage in SkutterZero; modify with setter messages. @done(18-04-15 15:34)
    ✔ (effectively done, since all those instance variables exist and can be accessed. But see above. @done(18-04-15 15:34)
✔ Pass instance variables to individual Skutter page templates. @done(18-04-15 15:34)
    ☐ ...proof-of-concept, but incomplete (and see above) @started(18-04-15 15:35)
☐ Colour control for Skutter pages.
☐ Page layout for A/B states, etc.

    ☐ Need linking, eg: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8966740/how-to-host-google-web-fonts-on-my-own-server
